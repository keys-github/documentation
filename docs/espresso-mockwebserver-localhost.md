<BrandName /> supports testing apps that use MockWebServer or similar localhost-based mock servers in Android Espresso tests.

## Why Special Configuration is Needed

When network capture (`network: true`) is enabled, HTTP requests from the device route through proxy. Localhost requests fail because the proxy runs on the host machine, not the device — so `http://localhost:{port}` resolves to the host's localhost instead of the device's.

Platform provides two solutions: **Localhost Bypass** and **Port Forwarding**.

## Option 1: Localhost Bypass

Best when app patching is enabled and your app uses standard HTTP libraries.

```json
{
  "app": "lt://APP_ID",
  "testSuite": "lt://TESTSUITE_ID",
  "device": ["Galaxy S21-12", "Pixel 6-13"],
  "build": "MockWebServer Test",
  "network": true,
  "localhost": true
}
```

| Capability | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `localhost` | Boolean | Bypass proxy for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` requests. Default: `false` |

### Supported HTTP Libraries

| Library | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Java HttpURLConnection** | `URL.openConnection()` is intercepted |
| **OkHttp** | `proxy()` and `proxySelector()` are intercepted |
| **Retrofit** | Uses OkHttp internally |
| **Volley** | Uses HttpURLConnection internally |

:::note Requirements
- `network: true` is required for `localhost: true` to work.
- Cannot be used together with `portForwarding`.
- Supported on both real devices and virtual devices.
:::

## Option 2: Port Forwarding

Best when app patching is unavailable or your app uses unsupported HTTP libraries.

```json
{
  "app": "lt://APP_ID",
  "testSuite": "lt://TESTSUITE_ID",
  "device": ["Galaxy S21-12", "Pixel 6-13"],
  "build": "MockWebServer Test",
  "network": true,
  "portForwarding": {
    "ports": [9091, 9092]
  }
}
```

| Capability | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `portForwarding` | Object | Configure port forwarding for localhost services on the device |
| `portForwarding.ports` | Array | Ports to forward (max 5 unique ports, must be 1024–65535) |

Port forwarding works at the network level, so **all HTTP libraries are supported**.

:::note
- Ports must be in the range 1024–65535. Privileged ports (1–1023) are blocked.
- Maximum 5 unique ports. No duplicate ports allowed.
- Invalid port formats (e.g., strings like `"abc"`) are rejected.
- Cannot be used together with `localhost`.
- `network: true` is **not** required for port forwarding — it works independently.
:::


## Troubleshooting

- **Connection errors** — Ensure `network: true` is set when using `localhost: true`. For `portForwarding`, `network: true` is optional.
- **Bypass not working** — Confirm your app uses a supported library, app patching is enabled, and your account has `mobile_universal_patching` and `combined_patching` flags.
- **"Cannot use localhost and portForwarding together"** — These are mutually exclusive. Pick one.
- **Port validation errors** — Ports must be 1024–65535, max 5 unique ports, no duplicates allowed.
